# Deplfolio

**Deplfolio** is a personal portfolio management tool that powers my online portfolio website. Instead of manually editing code or pushing new deployments, Deplfolio provides a simple and intuitive interface to update portfolio content in real time.

I created **Deplfolio** to streamline the way I manage my personal website. Instead of spending time redeploying code for every update, I wanted a system that lets me focus on what matters: showcasing my work, experience, and ideas â€” effortlessly.


## âœ¨ Features

- **Real-Time Updates** â€“ Instantly update your portfolio without writing code or redeploying the site.
- **No-Code Interface** â€“ Manage content with an easy-to-use dashboard or interface.
- **Always Up-to-Date** â€“ Ensure your live portfolio reflects your most current work, experience, and achievements.

## ðŸš€ Why Deplfolio?

Managing a personal portfolio shouldn't require code changes or version control. Deplfolio streamlines the process, letting you:

- Update About, Skills and Portfolio
- Remove or Add a New Skill
- Remove or Add a New Project
- Add new projects

â€”all without touching the codebase.
